? What is this?
Input encrypted text, get the decrypted text back.

"What type of encryption?"

That's the point. You don't know, you just know it's possibly encrypted. Ciphey will figure it out for you.

Ciphey can solve most things in 3 seconds or less.

Ciphey demo

Ciphey aims to be a tool to automate a lot of decryptions & decodings such as multiple base encodings, classical ciphers, hashes or more advanced cryptography.

If you don't know much about cryptography, or you want to quickly check the ciphertext before working on it yourself, Ciphey is for you.

The technical part. Ciphey uses a custom built artificial intelligence module (AuSearch) with a Cipher Detection Interface to approximate what something is encrypted with. And then a custom-built, customisable natural language processing Language Checker Interface, which can detect when the given text becomes plaintext.

No neural networks or bloated AI here. We only use what is fast and minimal.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. For the full technical explanation, check out our documentation.

? Features
50+ encryptions/encodings supported such as binary, Morse code and Base64. Classical ciphers like the Caesar cipher, Affine cipher and the Vigenere cipher. Along with modern encryption like repeating-key XOR and more. For the full list, click here
Custom Built Artificial Intelligence with Augmented Search (AuSearch) for answering the question "what encryption was used?" Resulting in decryptions taking less than 3 seconds.
Custom built natural language processing module Ciphey can determine whether something is plaintext or not. Whether that plaintext is JSON, a CTF flag, or English, Ciphey can get it in a couple of milliseconds.
Multi Language Support at present, only German & English (with AU, UK, CAN, USA variants).
Supports encryptions and hashes Which the alternatives such as CyberChef Magic do not.
C++ core Blazingly fast.
? Ciphey vs CyberChef
? Base64 Encoded 42 times
Name	? Ciphey ?	? CyberChef ?
Gif	The guy she tells you not to worry about	You
Time	2 seconds	6 seconds
Setup	
Run ciphey on the file
Set the regex param to "{"
You need to know how many times to recurse
You need to know it's Base64 all the way down
You need to load CyberChef (it's a bloated JS app)
Know enough about CyberChef to create this pipeline
Invert the match
Note The gifs may load at different times, so one may appear significantly faster than another.
A note on magic CyberChef's most similar feature to Ciphey is Magic. Magic fails instantly on this input and crashes. The only way we could force CyberChef to compete was to manually define it.

We also tested CyberChef and Ciphey with a 6gb file. Ciphey cracked it in 5 minutes and 54 seconds. CyberChef crashed before it even started.

??¡â?Running Ciphey
There are 3 ways to run Ciphey.

File Input ciphey -f encrypted.txt
Unqualified input ciphey -- "Encrypted input"
Normal way ciphey -t "Encrypted input"
Gif showing 3 ways to run Ciphey

To get rid of the progress bars, probability table, and all the noise use the quiet mode.

ciphey -t "encrypted text here" -q

For a full list of arguments, run ciphey --help.

?? Importing Ciphey
You can import Ciphey's main and use it in your own programs and code. from Ciphey.__main__ import main

? Contributors
Ciphey was invented by Bee in 2008, and revived in 2019. Ciphey wouldn't be where it was today without Cyclic3 - president of UoL's Cyber Security Society.

Ciphey was revived & recreated by the Cyber Security Society for use in CTFs. If you're ever in Liverpool, consider giving a talk or sponsoring our events. Email us at cybersecurity@society.liverpoolguild.org to find out more ?

Major Credit to George H for working out how we could use proper algorithms to speed up the search process. Special thanks to varghalladesign for designing the logo. Check out their other design work!
